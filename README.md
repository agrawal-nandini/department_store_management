# department_store_management

The Department Store Management System can be used to maintain a record of all the products that are present in the department store. Each product has essentially four details associated with it i.e., Name,
Unique Code, Current Quantity and Price. The current quantity in the database is influenced by the calculation of bill function.
The other inventory management functions that have been included in this project are -
1. Addition of goods
2. Deletion of goods
3. Searching of goods
4. Displaying Inventory
